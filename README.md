# Introduction to Computer Science
This is a repo for the gentle introduction to Computer Science for our students at Code Your Future in Glasgow. 

# Day 1
### Things to do before the class
* Set up an account at [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
* Watch the video [Work at Google — Example Coding/Engineering Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw)
* You are given an array of numbers: `[32, 16, 13, 9, 1, 99, 34, 64]`. Try to think in how many ways you can sort its elements. We are not interested here in using any programming language, just plain English. The following videos may help you to understand the idea behind the pseudocode: 
  - [Algorithms in pseudocode and flow diagrams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDWw4Ltfy5w)
  - [5 Minutes to Code: Programming Basics "Pseudocode"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhBrkpTqzqg)
  - [What's an algorithm? - David J. Malan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hfOvs8pY1k)

### Algorithms

##### What is an algorithm?  
  > Intuitively speaking, an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure (a “recipe”) for
  > performing a task. [1]

##### Why do we need algorithms? 
  - computers are stupid, so they need exact instructions
  - helps improve the performance
##### What is a characteristic of a good algorithm? 
  - efficient (speed and space)
  - correct
  - simple
##### How do we evaluate algoritms? 

### Abstract Data Types

1. What is a data structure?
  > Data structure is a systematic way of organising data and
  > making it accessible in certain ways. [1]
